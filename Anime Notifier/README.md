# Anime Notifier - Widget

Click here for the [latest release](https://github.com/SkinnyDevi/scriptable/releases/tag/anime-notifier-v1.6.1).

## Features (1.6.1)
- Show the latest five animes with thumbnails
- Choose to send notifications for your favourite animes with a custom user anime list
	- To add an anime to the notification list, go to the [anime website](https://goload.pro) and copy the anime name *exactly*.
	- Once copied, paste it inside the `NOTIFY_ME` list, with quotes around it, like this: `"Kono Healer, Mendokusai",`.
	- You'll be notified if that anime ever pops up as the first anime in the list.
- Sizes available right now: Large.
- Size complexity:
	- Complex widget version: displays multiple animes with a thumbnail for the latest animes
	- Simple widget version: displays only a list of the latest animes, no thumbnails

***Note: the widget refreshes every 15 minutes (unless refreshed manually) due to the system's limitations. Notifications and releases may or may not have a 15 minute difference, or not appear if the anime is not the first at refresh time.***
