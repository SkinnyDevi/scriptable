# Anime Notifier - iOS 14+ (Updared to iOS 16)

## Features (1.6.0)
- Show the latest five animes with thumbnails
- Choose to send notifications for your favourite animes with a custom user anime list!
- Sizes available right now: Large.
- Size complexity:
	- Complex widget version: displays multiple animes with a thumbnail for the latest animes
	- Simple widget version: displays only a list of the latest animes, no thumbnails

***Note: the widget refreshes every 15 minutes (unless refreshed manually) due to iOS 14+'s limitations. Notifications and releases may or may not have a 15 minute difference, or not appear if the anime is not the first at refresh time.***
