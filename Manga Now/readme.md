# NIOS - Scriptable project example
This repo serves as an example on how to work on a Scriptable script using TypeScript with NIOS.

## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have NodeJS and NPM installed locally.
2. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/SkinnyDevi/nios-scriptable-project-example
```
3. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
4. Start watching your TypeScript script using `start`
```
npm start
```

Now, you may change your `.ts` script, and all your changes will output to JavaScript in the
`javascript` folder.
